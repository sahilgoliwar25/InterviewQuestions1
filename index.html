    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <h3>Q1. Difference between Div and Span.</h3>
    <p>
      Ans. Div tag is a block element i.e. it uses the whole area and any text
      added after this tag is automatically shifted to next line. It is
      generally used to wrap some content which then can be used in designing
      purpose where as Span tag is an Inline element which utilizes only the
      area having the content in it. Any other content added after this tag will
      be continued post this tag. It is generally used to wrap the text or a
      particular word and highlight make some changes to it.
    </p>
    <p><b>Example:</b></p>
    <div>This is text inside Div tag.</div>
    This is text outside Div tag.

    <h3>Q2. Difference between class and IDs.</h3>
    <p>
      Ans. ID is always unique within an HTML Page whereas Class with the same
      name can be applied multiple times within an HTML Page. When we use style
      tag with ID we use id="demo" with tag and #demo for style. Similarly when
      we use style tag with class we use class="demo" with tag and .demo for
      style.

      Whatever is written inside this symbol are considered as tag.
